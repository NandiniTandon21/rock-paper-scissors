# Rock-Paper-Scissors (Console Game)

**Author**: Nandini Tandon  
**IDE Used**: Visual Studio Code  

This is an assignment from *The Odin Project*, where I developed a simple Rock-Paper-Scissors game. This project challenged me to think critically about designing functions, managing variables within functions, and leveraging global functions effectively.  

While working on this, I explored two approaches:
1. Implementing the game using browser-based `window.prompt` for user input.
2. Creating the game in a Node.js environment by using the `readline` module to interact with the console. I utilized `process.stdin` and `process.stdout` for input and output, `rl.question` for querying the user, and `rl.close` to cleanly end the game.

This assignment gave me hands-on experience with asynchronous operations in Node.js and helped me understand how to manage user input/output efficiently across different environments.
